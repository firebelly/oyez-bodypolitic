        <h3><span class="sub-chapter-numeral">1.1</span>Who was Roe?</h3>

        <p>In 1970, a Texas woman named Norma McCorvey sought to terminate her pregnancy, but was blocked by state law. This was McCorvey’s third pregnancy; her first child was raised by her mother, and her second child was put up for adoption. She found Linda Coffee and Sarah Weddington, two Texas lawyers who wanted to bring a suit challenging the Texas statute restricting abortion access. To protect her privacy in the case, she was recorded in court documents under the pseudonym Jane Roe.</p>

        <h3><span class="sub-chapter-numeral">1.2</span>What was abortion law like then?</h3>

        <div class="aside-wrap">
          <p>At the time, abortion law was a complex national patchwork. Four states had repealed anti-abortion laws completely, and 13 states had reformed abortion laws to allow for certain circumstances beyond a danger to the woman’s health, known as the <span class="aside-trigger first-item" data-aside="ali-model"><span class="notice-me"><svg class="icon icon-info"><use xlink:href="#icon-info"></use></svg></span>ALI model</span> (after the American Law Institute, which proposed the model). The remaining 37 states had much stricter regulations on the procedure. Crossing state lines for an abortion was not uncommon for women who could afford such travel. In 1972, the year before the Court decided <em>Roe</em>, an estimated 100,000 women traveled to New York, the only state that did not have a residency requirement. Most women who could not afford the trip had to carry their pregnancy to term, but by some estimates, upwards of 200,000 women per year performed dangerous self-abortions.</p>

            <svg class="icon icon-info"><use xlink:href="#icon-info"></use></svg>
            <p>The ALI model "permitted abortion if the pregnant woman's life, physical health or mental health were endangered; if the fetus would be born with severe physical or mental defect; or if the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest."</p>

He does not know if the death must be certain, or if it could be an increase in probability of her death. So here, in the District, doctors are able to exercise their normal matter of judgment, whether or not the health of the woman, mental or physical will be affected. But, in Texas, we tell the doctor that unless he can decide whether it's necessary for the purpose of saving her life, and for no other reason, that he is subject to criminal sanctions.”</p><cite>— Sarah R.

        <div class="aside-wrap">
          <p><em>Roe v. Wade</em> established two major things. First, states could not regulate abortions during the <span class="aside-trigger first-item" data-aside="opinion-quote-1"><span class="notice-me"><svg class="icon icon-info"><use xlink:href="#icon-info"></use></svg></span>first trimester</span>, because it represented a private medical decision between a woman and her doctor. This was grounded in the <span class="aside-trigger first-item" data-aside="opinion-quote-2"><span class="notice-me"><svg class="icon icon-info"><use xlink:href="#icon-info"></use></svg></span>right to privacy</span>, but <span class="aside-trigger first-item" data-aside="opinion-quote-3"><span class="notice-me"><svg class="icon icon-info"><use xlink:href="#icon-info"></use></svg></span>for the doctor more than for the woman</span>. The other major holding was that states could regulate abortion later on in pregnancy. After the first trimester, they could regulate the procedure to protect the health of the mother, and in the <span class="aside-trigger first-item" data-aside="viability-stage"><span class="notice-me"><svg class="icon icon-info"><use xlink:href="#icon-info"></use></svg></span>viability stage</span>, the state could regulate or prohibit abortion and to preserve the <span class="aside-trigger first-item" data-aside="opinion-quote-4"><span class="notice-me"><svg class="icon icon-info"><use xlink:href="#icon-info"></use></svg></span>potential life</span> (with exceptions for the health of the mother).

        <p>Justice Blackmun unintentionally became a symbol of the women’s rights movement. While he initially distanced himself from the issue, he eventually came to embrace the cause.</p>

        <p>Norma McCorvey, or Jane Roe, had her child long before the case reached the Supreme Court. After being given up for adoption, the identity of the child has remained private. McCorvey was baptized into the Catholic church in 1998 and is now a strong pro-life activist. In 2003, she filed suit in federal court to void the judgment in <em>Roe v. Wade</em>. The court found that since over 30 years had passed since the decision, it was unreasonable to reopen the case. The Fifth Circuit upheld the lower court’s decision, and the Supreme Court declined to hear the case.</p>

        <p>Public opinion since the decision has remained widely divided. Justice Blackmun received many letters of thanks from women around the country, but also approximately 80,000 hate letters. Even some proponents of abortion rights have been critical of <em>Roe</em>. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has said, “My criticism of <em>Roe</em> is that it seemed to have stopped momentum on the side of change.” In other words, the decision came too soon, before a majority of public opinion came to support the cause. In fact, when the decision came down, 45 states were considering legislation to reform their abortion laws in some way.</p>

        <h4>Quick take:</h4>

        <ul>
          <li>Although <em>Roe v. Wade</em> has not been overturned, it’s not the law of the land anymore. Later decisions at the Supreme Court and legislation passed in Congress have shifted its guarantees and protections.</li>
          <li><em>Roe v. Wade</em>’s opinion focuses on the protection of doctors’ rights much more than it does on women’s rights.</li>
