        <h3><span class="sub-chapter-numeral">4.1</span>What happened after Carhart?</h3>

        <p>States have continued to pass laws around abortion, but no major federal laws have been passed. Without clear standards of what is acceptable, state laws differ drastically. For example, Indiana requires the procedure to be performed by a licensed physician, and abortion is banned after 20 weeks of pregnancy - except in cases of danger to the mother, in which case the procedure must be performed at a hospital with a second participating physician. Other states, like Colorado, have none of these regulations.</p>

        <h3><span class="sub-chapter-numeral">4.2</span>What was the law in question?</h3>

        <p>Texas House Bill 2, or HB2, received national attention when then-State Senator Wendy Davis filibustered it for 11 hours before it was ultimately passed by the Texas legislature and signed into law. HB2 contains two major provisions regarding abortion. The first requires physicians in Texas who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the abortion clinic. The second holds abortion clinics to the same facilities standard as ambulatory surgical centers. These provisions require a myriad of structural updates to many abortion clinics in the state. Supporters of the bill argue that HB2 is intended to protect women’s health.</p>

        <h3><span class="sub-chapter-numeral">4.3</span>What was the case against the law?</h3>

        <p>The petitioners argue that while HB2 alleges to protect women’s health, the intended and actual effect of the bill is to limit women’s access to abortion across the state. Opponents say it would force 75% of clinics across the state of Texas to close, leaving thousands of square miles between San Antonio and the New Mexico border without any clinics. A pillar of their argument is that abortion is considered a relatively safe procedure, so these strict regulations are unnecessary for women’s health. Supporters of the bill respond by pointing to examples of unsafe abortion providers and the need to regulate for the protection of women.</p>

        <h3><span class="sub-chapter-numeral">4.4</span>How has the Court changed since Carhart?</h3>

        <p>Since its decision in <em>Carhart II</em>, the Supreme Court has shifted. Although Justices John Paul Stevens and David Souter had been appointed by conservative presidents, they usually voted along more traditionally liberal or centrist lines. They each retired during President Obama’s tenure and were replaced by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, both consistent members of the Court’s liberal coalition.</p>

        <div class="aside-wrap">
          <p>When the case was first granted, there were nine justices on the bench. But just before it was argued, Justice Antonin Scalia unexpectedly passed away at the age of 79. Justice Scalia was a well-known conservative voice on the bench who, in several cases, made clear that he did not view abortion as a constitutional right. His passing left eight justices on the bench: four liberals, three conservatives, and one <span class="aside-trigger first-item" data-aside="swing-vote"><span class="notice-me"><svg class="icon icon-info"><use xlink:href="#icon-info"></use></svg></span>swing vote</span> - Justice Anthony Kennedy, who had voted to uphold the right to abortion in <em>Casey</em>, but had written the opinion restricting late-term abortions in <em>Carhart II</em>.</p>

        <div class="aside-wrap">
          <p>Stephanie Toti, the advocate for the abortion clinics, laid out the case that the law does not actually protect <span class="aside-trigger audio-trigger first-item" data-aside="oral-argument-1"><span class="notice-me"><svg class="icon icon-audio"><use xlink:href="#icon-audio"></use></svg></span>women’s health</span>. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli argued as amicus curiae for the United States on the side of the abortion clinics. He emphasized the need to give weight to the <span class="aside-trigger audio-trigger first-item" data-aside="oral-argument-2"><span class="notice-me"><svg class="icon icon-audio"><use xlink:href="#icon-audio"></use></svg></span>undue burden standard</span>, and that defining it in this case would be crucial moving forward.</p>

            <blockquote><p>“The American Medical Association and every other mainstream leading medical association to consider these requirements has -- has concluded that they are not medically justified for a variety of reasons, including that they impose these onerous burdens on medical abortion, which is the earliest form of abortion, and that these burdens are also imposed on early surgical abortion, procedures prior to 16 weeks. And as a result, women are going to be delayed later in pregnancy. And there is evidence in the record that following implementation of the admitting-privileges requirement, in the six-month period following, there was an increase in both the number and the proportion of abortions being performed in the second trimester. So by delaying women's access to abortion, these requirements are actually increasing the risks that women face.”</p><cite>— Stephanie Toti, advocate for Whole Woman's Health</cite></blockquote>

          <p>Scott Keller, the attorney for the state of Texas, was questioned intensely by the three female justices.

What evidence is there that under the prior law, the prior law was not sufficiently protective of the women's health?

As far as we know, this is among the most safe, the least risk procedures, an early-stage abortion.

        <h3><span class="sub-chapter-numeral">4.6</span>What could the decision say?</h3>

        <p>Check back after the decision is released for our analysis. Until then, here are some potential outcomes.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>An equally divided Court votes 4-4, and the decision of the lower court is affirmed. If this is the outcome, the law remains in place, but no national precedent is set.</li>
          <li>The justices hold the case over to next term for reargument, so that it can be heard by a full bench.</li>
          <li>The Court remands the case to a lower court for further arguments or fact-finding, which could have the effect of delaying the Court’s say on the matter until there are nine justices.</li>
          <li>The Court rules for the petitioners (the abortion clinics), and overturns or limits HB2. There is a wide range of possible outcomes in this instance.</li>
          <li>The Court rules for the respondents (Texas), and HB2 stays in place and similar laws across the country are permissible.</li>

        <h4>Quick take:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>This is the first time a reproductive rights case has gone before a bench with three female justices. Most of the recent cases had had only one, while Justices Sandra Day O’Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg were both on the bench for <em>Carhart I</em>.</li>
          <li>A law similar to the Texas one was passed recently in Louisiana, and challengers appealed to the Supreme Court. After the Court heard arguments in <em>Whole Woman’s Health</em>, the justices put a stay on the Louisiana law and thus blocked its enforcement. While the Court’s inner workings are shrouded in mystery, this could be a sign that the Texas law may not stand as it is.</li>
